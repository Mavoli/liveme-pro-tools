### END OF DEVELOPMENT

```
I will no longer be maintaining the LiveMe Pro Tools starting March 11, 2020 due to availability to
continue this project.  What started as a small challenge to do better has grown massive in 2 years.
I see the results of so many who have used it all over the web, even in discussions where users help
each other.  It's been fun and I've enjoyed working with so many people around the world.

I will keep this repo alive and allow new contributors to become part to help continue this project
if they want to help keep the tools going forever.  Just email me or leave a private message for me
on the Gitter chat room.

Have a good one everyone!

### Getting Support or Assistance

The [Gitter](https://gitter.im/thecoderstoolbox/liveme-pro-tools) group is still open for people to discuss usage and such.

**Please note that the LiveMe platform itself is riddled with bugs and errors and this project has demonstrated those errors on many occasions so be prepared for no answers if you have issues.**

***I DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE OR ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THIS OR ANY OTHER OF MY PROJECTS, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME SENDING THEM!***

### What Is LiveMe Pro Tools?
Its an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) based application for Live.me Social Video network for:

- View public replays for user accounts
- See and navigate user's followers and followings
- Watch and download replays
- Allows downloading of replays using internal downloader or FFMPEG
- FFMPEG Hardware-Accelerated video transcoding supported on Linux only!  
  - Fully supports VAAPI on AMD and Intel cards for now.

### Building LiveMe Pro Tools

**Instructions can be found in the DOCS folder on building the various branches of this project.**

### Prebuilt Releases (64-bit only!)

To download the latest prebuilt versions, [click here](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-pro-tools/releases/latest).

**Current Supported Platforms (64-bit only):**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (64-bit)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (64-bit!)

### 32-bit versions???
**Since we've moved to using newer technologies, keeping support for 32-bit versions has been harder to maintain now so we dropped building them January 1st, 2019.**

You are more than welcome to download the source and build your own 32-bit version, but support for issues will be limited.

* * *

### FFMPEG No Longer Required?
You can choose to use a basic built-in concat system now to join the chunks downloaded without needing to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.  Or for better support, you can still use FFMPEG settings.

If you wish to transcode the downloads, then you will need to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.
