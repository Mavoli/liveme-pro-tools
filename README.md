### What Is LiveMe Pro Tools?
Its an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) based application for Live.me Social Video network for:
- Search and browse user accounts
- View public replays for user accounts
- See and navigate user's followers and followings
- Watch and download replays
- Allows downloading of replays using FFMPEG
- Supports [LAMD](https://notabug.org/thecoder75/lamd)

### Prebuilt Releases
**Releases will now be built by TheCoder and added as updates warrant them.

**Planned Supported Platforms:**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (32 and 64-bit)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (32 and 64-bit!)

** Please note support for 32-bit will be dropped in the near future of the main branch and a special branch supporting it will be created instead but may not be updated as often as the main branch.**

### What about FFMPEG?
Unfortunately at this time, every way I've looked at removing it has caused major breakage in the ability to download non-broken replays.

### A Desktop Version?
A long time ago, TheCoder wanted to release an actual desktop app that wasn't built using NodeJS and ElectronJS.  This was being researched and planned but due to him getting a promotion at work, his available time for this project disappeared.  Now with what little time he has, he will try to maintain and perform minor updates as he is able to.

### Current Releases Built With
* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
* LiveMe-API - *now integrated into the project*

### Contributing
If you find any bugs or would like to help add features or additional functions, please create a pull request for review and I'll add them if they don't break anything.
