# LiveMe Pro Tools
## A review of the code-base is underway for a possible partial or complete fix/rewrite by TheCoder.  No timeframe or dates are set yet for any releases.

### What Is LiveMe Pro Tools?
Its an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) based application for Live.me Social Video network for:
- Search and browse user accounts
- View public replays for user accounts
- See and navigate user's followers and followings
- Watch and download replays
- Allows downloading of replays using FFMPEG
- Supports [LAMD](https://thecoderstoolbox.com/lamd)

### Prebuilt Releases
**Any new builds in the future will be made available for download in the [Releases](https://notabug.org/thecoder1975/liveme-pro-tools/releases) section.**

**Supported Platforms:**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (64-bit only!)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (64-bit only!)

### What about FFMPEG?
The code-base is being reviewed for possible removal of dependancy of FFMPEG at this time.

### A Desktop Version?
A long time ago, TheCoder wanted to release an actual desktop app that wasn't built using NodeJS and ElectronJS.  This is now being reviewed and different programming languages are being reviewed for which one would work in the long run on all platforms with the least amount of difficulty when compiling executables.
